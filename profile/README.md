# Enable two-factor authentication by November 14 2023

[GovAlta](https://github.com/GovAlta/) will enforce two-factor authentication (2FA) on November 14th, 2023.

GitHub users are [now required](https://github.blog/2023-03-09-raising-the-bar-for-software-security-github-2fa-begins-march-13/) to enable 2FA as an additional security measure. Your activity on GitHub includes you in this requirement. You will need to enable 2FA on your account before November 14, 2023, or be restricted from account actions.

A guide to configure 2FA can be referenced [here](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/securing-your-account-with-two-factor-authentication-2fa/configuring-two-factor-authentication). Please forward your questions or concerns to [GoA GitHub-Service](mailto:GoA.GitHub-Service@gov.ab.ca?subject=RE:%20GitHub:%20GovAlta%20Public%20-%20Enable%20two-factor%20authentication%20by%20November%2014%202023).
